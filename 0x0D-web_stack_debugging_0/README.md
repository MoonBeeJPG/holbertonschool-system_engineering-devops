## Tasks
### 0. Give me a page!
Be sure to read the  **Docker**  concept page

In this first debugging project, you will need to get  [Apache](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/B4vOap4dPNKxdZzBbepK7Q "Apache")  to run on the container and to return a page containing  `Hello Holberton`  when querying the root of it.
After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains `Hello Holberton`. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.
